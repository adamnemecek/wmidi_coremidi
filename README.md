# wmidi_coremidi

Implementation of the `WebMIDI`.

Based on [WebMIDIKit](https://github.com/adamnemecek/WebMIDIKit).

<!-- 
# potentially useful rust features
* mpsc::receiver
* pinning?
-->

<!-- Uses coremidi-sys as opposed to coremidi since coremidi imposes -->

* which is better api, create a receiver and have the user get it or have the user pass it in?
